# Devlog

A narrative history of clikae, from the first commit through a deliberate park and
the v0.6 that earned its way out of it.
For the precise, per-release record see [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/linyiru/clikae/blob/4229d5d47c272d533ebd8a05a949d94a32455ebb/CHANGELOG.md) — this is
the story around it: the itch, the wrong turns, and the lessons that made each
version what it is. Dates are the real tag dates (JST); claims map to the
changelog. Nothing here is roadmap or aspiration — only what actually shipped.

## The itch

Two Claude subscriptions, because one Max plan kept running dry mid-task. A Codex
login. Antigravity. All in different terminals, on different projects, half of
them unfinished. The recurring small pain wasn't dramatic — it was the daily
*"which account was that in, and what was I even doing?"*, followed by a `/clear`
and re-explaining the whole project to a fresh session on a fresh quota.

clikae started as the dumbest possible fix for that: give each account its own
config directory, write a shell alias, done. The interesting part — carrying a
*live* session onto another account so the conversation survives the quota wall —
came later, and turned out to be the actual point.

## The timeline

### v0.1.0 — 2026-05-28 · the scaffold

The first commit (untagged; the public tags begin at v0.2.0). A pure-bash CLI
dispatcher with a small modular `lib/`, and exactly the verbs you'd expect:
`init` a profile, write an `alias`, generate a double-click `.app` launcher,
`run` a CLI under a profile, plus `list` / `remove`. One built-in adapter —
Claude Code, via `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` — and a template for adding more. MIT, and
the pitch was already "every line is auditable."

### v0.2.0 — 2026-05-28 · six more adapters, and `migrate`

Same evening, six more built-in adapters (gh, gcloud, docker, helm, kubectl,
aws), and `clikae migrate` to *adopt* the hand-rolled `~/.claude-acct-{a,b}`
setup people already had instead of asking them to start over. Also a bats suite
and the first real bug caught by it: `clikae app` had been generating an
uncompilable AppleScript the whole of v0.1, because BSD `sed` strips backslashes
from the replacement string. A path that's never exercised is a path that's
quietly broken.

### v0.3.0 — 2026-05-29 · Homebrew, and the Keychain footgun

`brew install CVERInc/clikae/clikae` started working. And the first piece of
hard-won macOS knowledge got encoded: Claude Code keys its OAuth token in the
login Keychain by the *config-dir path*, so moving a profile forces a re-login —
unless `migrate --keep-login` carries the token across. The token never leaves
the Keychain; clikae just teaches it the new address.

### v0.4.0 — 2026-05-30 · breadth (az, npm, terraform, pulumi) and Windows

Four more adapters (eleven total) and a native PowerShell port for people who
don't have bash. A `migrate` in-use guard, too — refusing to pull a config
directory out from under a live session. (The Windows port later got demoted; see
v0.5.0. It was a good-faith experiment that the maintained grammar outgrew.)

### v0.5.0 — 2026-06-01 · clikae becomes a verb

The pivot. The name is 切り替え — *switching* — so the headline action stopped
carrying a verb of its own: `clikae <engine> <tank>` switches and runs. One
`clikae to <target>` carries your current session onward — same engine resumes,
a different engine gets a written brief. The vocabulary settled on **engine** and
**tank** and **fuel/dry**. This release also brought `status`, `relay`, `handoff`
(a portable, vendor-neutral session brief for when the next tank starts blind),
`watch` (ambient "notice a dry tank, switch"), `--ephemeral` throwaway memory,
`--json` for the planned GUI, and a first interactive home board.

It also brought the honesty that became a house rule. `watch`'s limit-detection
shipped with a frank caveat *in the code and the `--help`*: an interactive CLI
hitting its limit fires no hook and returns no exit code, so the only signal is
what the limit writes into the transcript — and the exact marker was *not yet
confirmed against a real limit event*. Better to ship the caveat than to ship a
promise the platform can't keep.

Windows support was reframed here as community/unsupported — it's bash, and
that's the pitch.

### v0.5.1 — 2026-06-01 · a logo that reflows

A responsive welcome screen: on a wide terminal the copy sits beside the logo, on
a narrow one it stacks, measured with `stty size` (because `tput cols` lies
inside a command substitution). Small, but it's the first thing a newcomer sees.

### v0.5.2 — 2026-06-02 · the board leads with "continue"

The release that quietly changed what clikae *is* — from an account switcher into
a continuity dashboard. The board now opens with your most recent sessions across
all tanks, each titled by Claude's own AI-generated name, each with a one-line
**recap** of where you left off — read for free from Claude's own session
summary. And when you carry a session across engines, the brief is written by a
**local** model already on your machine (apfel, ollama, llm) if one's there:
private, free, offline. Your session content — which may include source or
secrets — never leaves the machine to make the handoff.

### v0.5.3 — 2026-06-02 · one burn order, and i18n

Your tanks became a single flat **burn order**, and the board *is* that order —
rearrange in place with `[` / `]`, and `clikae <name>` switches by name alone.
The separate, undiscoverable "fuel pool" concept was deleted outright (you
couldn't set it from the board, and it duplicated the tanks clikae already knew).
A supervised auto-carry landed as BETA — start claude *through* clikae and it
carries you onward when you hit the wall, in the same terminal. No daemon: it only
acts on a session you launched through it. Deliberate. And interface localisation
arrived — en-US / ja-JP / zh-TW — with the katakana wordmark ｷﾘｶｴ kept only in
Japanese.

### v0.5.4 — 2026-06-03 · the dot becomes a fuel gauge

The board's status dot used to mean "you are here" — except it meant a global
symlink for agy and a per-shell env var for claude, which is exactly the
switcher-thinking clikae had stopped being. So it became a fuel gauge, one axis,
like a traffic light: red dry, green ready, ○ no reading (honestly blank for
engines clikae can't read off disk — never a guessed green). "Which tank am I on"
moved to where it belongs: the cursor. The yellow weekly-usage caution dot
shipped here too, as BETA — it captures Claude's "used N% of your weekly limit"
notice *verbatim* (disk has no weekly denominator to compute one), and until that
notice is observed reaching a stream clikae can tail, yellow simply never lights.

### v0.5.5 — 2026-06-04 · agy goes real multi-account, and `burn` arrives

Antigravity keeps its Google login in one machine-wide Keychain item, so swapping
the `~/.gemini` symlink alone left every agy tank riding the *same* account.
`clikae agy <tank>` now carries the login *with* the tank, Keychain to Keychain,
the token never touching disk. And `clikae burn` — the headless guarded task
runner — landed: it verifies a task by the **artifact** it must produce, never the
exit code, because `codex exec` cheerfully exits 0 even when it hit its limit and
wrote nothing. (Trusting an exit code here would be the bug; the artifact is the
truth.)

### v0.5.6 — 2026-06-04 · a one-line fix for a one-line regression

v0.5.5's new cross-shell process guard leaked `ps`'s exit code, so under
`set -eo pipefail` a `ps` that couldn't run — on a locked-down host or a sandbox —
took the whole command down instead of degrading to "couldn't scan, proceed." The
scan is meant to be best-effort. Now it actually is. With a regression test, so a
deliberately failing `ps` must never again abort a rename.

### v0.5.7 — 2026-06-04 · the board is fuel tanks only

Tool-CLI tanks (gh, npm, aws) aren't AI sessions — "launching" one only printed a
usage screen — so they moved off the board into the full `clikae tanks`
inventory. `app --board` shipped: one double-click button for the whole on-ramp.
And a small Ghostty saga got solved: Ghostty pops an "Allow Ghostty to execute…?"
dialog for an injected `-e` command, so a launcher looked like an empty shell
until you clicked Allow. Passing the command through a trusted `--config-file`
(and re-signing the bundle so Apple Silicon doesn't block it) makes the window
just open.

### v0.5.8 — 2026-06-04 · carry onward from a dry tank

Pressing Enter on a dry tank's board row used to dead-end on "resume" or "open
fresh" — both of which only put you back on the exhausted quota, which is the one
thing you didn't want. Now a dry row leads with *carry this session onto the next
fuelled tank*. The next-tank selector became a ring: it circles the whole burn
order (a tank *above* you is still a reserve), prefers a fuelled same-engine tank,
and skips any tank whose account is already dry — because a usage limit hits the
whole account, so hopping to a sibling on the same login would just land on the
same empty quota.

### v0.5.9 — 2026-06-05 · a quiet update notice, and honest snapshot times

A codex-style "✨ Update available" notice on the board: update now / skip / skip
until next version — throttled to once a day, cached, offline-safe, fully
opt-out (`CLIKAE_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1`), and shown only when it can name the right
command for your install rather than guessing one. (This is also the one network
call clikae makes; the README later owned up to that.) Plus the ability to carry a
session onward even when the tank *isn't* dry, and a "· seen HH:MM" tag on
snapshot reset times — because codex reports its limit in UTC for a different
window than its own TUI shows, and clikae would rather frame a number as a
snapshot than pretend it's a live countdown.

### v0.5.10 — 2026-06-05 · the *real* burn fix

The footgun with a name (燒爆 — "burning yourself up"): `clikae burn claude <X>`
could reroute its dry-fallthrough onto the very tank an *interactive* session was
live on, silently spending that conversation's quota. A 2026-06-05 dogfood had
declared this fixed — after testing **codex only**. It wasn't; the claude path was
never covered and was confirmed still live. Lesson, now written down: don't clear
a multi-engine bug by testing one engine. `burn` now skips a tank an interactive
session holds, and `--allow-active` overrides if you really mean it.

### v0.5.11 — 2026-06-05 · the "is this actually a bug?" audit

A pass that compared what clikae *claimed* against what it *did*, with help from a
few parallel agents. The headline find: `clikae watch` — a headline feature —
shipped broken, calling a helper that was never defined, so it could crash before
tailing anything. No test had covered that line. Fixed, and covered. Out of the
audit came `docs/EXPECTATIONS.md`, an "is this a bug?" guide to the deliberate-
but-surprising behaviours (the fuel dot isn't "you are here", codex resets in UTC,
agy switches globally, limits are account-level, …), and a sweep of doc
corrections — including that the board's language key is `l`, not `h`, which every
doc had managed to get wrong in unison.

### v0.5.12 — 2026-06-05 · state schema versioning

Groundwork, invisible in normal use: everything under `$CLIKAE_HOME/` now carries
a `version` marker, so a future change to an on-disk format is safe — clikae reads
it on startup and migrates forward, and *warns* rather than downgrading if a newer
clikae wrote your state. Deliberately minimal: one version file, one migration
runner, no framework. The stamp is written only when state is created, so read
commands stay strictly read-only. This was the last item on the world-class-gaps
punch-list.

### v0.5.13 — 2026-06-07 · `burn` hardened, agy docs made honest

Two real dogfood runs surfaced a correctness landmine: a *stale* artifact left
over from a previous run could make a failed task look like it succeeded. Success
is now judged by the artifact appearing *or its timestamp changing* (via the
existing GNU-stat-first mtime helper — a self-authored BSD-first version would
have returned garbage on Linux; review caught it). `--fresh` deletes the artifact
before running; `--timeout` gained a `perl` alarm fallback for stock macOS, which
ships neither `timeout` nor `gtimeout`; and a one-line summary closes each run.
The agy docs got more precise too: its *state* follows `$HOME`, but its *login* is
one global Keychain entry — which is the real reason switching is global.

### v0.5.14 — 2026-06-07 · the park

A doc- and comment-only release, cut so the published tarball exactly matches
`main`. It drops a phantom `$CLIKAE_HOME/adapters` TODO that was never implemented
(no-phantom-features, applied to a comment), and marks the world-class-gaps
handoff historical now that its punch-list is cleared. Nothing behaves
differently — this release exists to leave the repo tidy.

### v0.6.0 — 2026-06-14 · un-parked, into vertical orchestration

The park clause said a sharp-enough itch would earn a v0.6. The itch arrived as
three files from a collaborator: a "conductor" Claude Code skill — `claude-leg.sh`,
`codex-leg.sh`, and a `SKILL.md` — that fires a headless leg at another model, on
another account, and reads the whole result back. It was, almost line for line, the
one edge the park note had reserved as clikae's own: *carrying an expensive
orchestrator onto cheap context.* Better still, those files had independently
rediscovered clikae's hardest-won doctrine — judge a headless run by its **output**,
never its exit code; close stdin so it can't hang; fall back to a `perl` alarm when
there's no coreutils `timeout`. Two parties arriving at the same rule is the rule
earning its keep.

So v0.6.0 makes that edge first-class. The split stays clean — the **brain** (a
conductor: you, or a session model) decides; clikae stays the **muscle** that
routes accounts, detects dry, and fans work out, and never judges the result:

- **`clikae conduct` (BETA)** fans one prompt headless and read-only across N
  accounts in parallel — each on its own subscription — and hands you every full
  result to choose from. It does not grade them; keeping clikae out of the judging
  is what keeps it a switcher, not a middleman.
- **`clikae git-id`** (issue #22) pins a tank's git commit identity, so a dispatched
  write-job can't stamp commits with the engine's account email — the exact §13
  incident that once leaked nine commits to the wrong GitHub account.
- **`clikae burn --prompt-file`** (issue #24) ends the hand-rolled headless flags:
  clikae fills each engine's write-mode dialect from a new `adapter_burn_flags`
  hook, so a cross-engine reroute regenerates the *right* flags instead of shipping
  claude's to codex. The raw `-- <cmd>` form still works for power users.

The lessons came, as they always do, from letting something independent check the
work. An adversarial audit — run, fittingly, on a separate model — caught two bugs
every test had missed because every test prompt was a single line: the
newline-framed adapter recipes **shattered a multi-line prompt** into one argv item
per line (fixed by switching the framing to NUL), and `conduct` called an empty leg
a *success* because `printf '%s\n' ""` still writes a byte (fixed by judging the
captured output, not the file's size). Both are the "judge by output, not exit
code" rule wearing new clothes; both are now locked by tests — including a real
`git commit` end-to-end proving the pinned identity actually beats `git config`.

And a dogfood that wrote itself: fanning real research legs at a tank that was
genuinely dry made the leg *report the limit honestly* instead of faking success —
and surfaced how a person **sees** a dispatched fleet from inside a Claude Code
session: the footer's `· N shells ·`, the `↓` manager, and the trick of leading
each background command with a `[tank·role]` token so the manager labels itself.
That became `docs/orchestration.md` — a playbook written as much for an LLM driving
clikae as for a person, which is the honest reframe v0.6 settled on: clikae is a
tool for an LLM to command other LLMs, and the human mostly sets strategy and holds
the red-line buttons.

## The park held — then its own clause fired

The strategy hasn't changed: clikae is a portfolio piece, an on-ramp, and a tip jar
— not a revenue product. A pure-bash CLI on Homebrew has roughly zero convenience
moat to charge for, and the niche is crowded (Quotio, Relay, caam, and a graveyard
of auth-switchers). v0.6.0 didn't betray that — `conduct` ships **BETA**, off the
README's headline, opt-in, never pushed uphill as a business. What changed is only
that the park's own clause came true: the one edge it had reserved — carrying an
expensive orchestrator onto cheap context — got sharp enough, and handed-over
enough, to earn the version it was promised.

Its narrower edge stays sharp: no proxy, no daemon, no telemetry — every line
auditable. The bones were good and ready; the itch finally arrived. clikae is,
again, complete for this stage — now with a brain it can lend to whoever's
conducting.
