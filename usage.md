# Using clikae

**clikae is a verb** (切り替え, *switching*). The headline action carries no verb
of its own — the program name is the verb:

```bash
clikae <engine> <tank>      # switch <engine> to <tank> and run it
```

An `<engine>` is a CLI with an adapter (run `clikae adapters`); a `<tank>` is a
name you choose (`A-Z a-z 0-9 . _ -` allowed) for one account/config. The fuel
metaphor runs throughout: a tank holds an engine's quota (its *fuel*); when a
tank runs *dry* you carry your work onward with `clikae to`.

Run `clikae help <command>` for the full per-command reference. The full design
of the language is in [grammar.md](grammar.md).

## Quick tour

```bash
# Create a tank for Claude Code, and add the matching shell alias
clikae init claude work --alias

# Switch to it and run — the bare verb (no `run` needed)
clikae claude work
clikae claude work -- --help    # args after -- go straight to the engine

# Or pick up the alias and use that
source ~/.zshrc                 # or your rc file
claude-work

# Generate a macOS launcher you can double-click from ~/Applications
clikae app claude work

# See what you've got
clikae tanks                    # alias: clikae list
#   ENGINE       TANK
#   claude       work
clikae tanks -p                 # also print the tank directory paths

# Tear it all down (tank dir + alias + .app, asks to confirm)
clikae remove claude work
```

## Commands

clikae is the verb, so **switching needs no verb**; management commands keep
plain, conventional verbs.

### Switch (the main thing)

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `<engine> <tank> [-- args]` | Switch `<engine>` to `<tank>` and run it. The bare verb. (`run` is a hidden alias.) |
| `<engine> <tank> --ephemeral` | Switch and run with **ephemeral memory** — this session's long-term memory is a throwaway, discarded on exit; the tank's real memory is left untouched. Login + transcripts are normal. claude only (clikae must know the memory layout). See below. |
| `<engine>` | One tank → use it; several → list them; none → offer to create. |
| `to <target> [tank] [-- args]` | Carry **this shell's current session** onto another tank. Same engine → a real resume; a different engine → a written brief (cold start). clikae announces which. Source is auto-detected (env var, else this directory's most recent session). Forwards relay's `-y`/`--fresh`/`--session`. (`relay`/`handoff`/`continue` are hidden aliases.) |
| `resume [session-id] [-- args]` | Reopen a **specific past session** by id, in whichever tank owns it — clikae scans every tank, finds the owner, cd's to the directory the session was recorded in, and resumes it there (fixes the bare `<engine> --resume <id>` "No conversation found" when the session lives in a tank, not the engine's default home). With **no id** it opens an interactive picker across **all** tanks (claude/codex/antigravity), newest first — filter with `/`, move with arrows/`j`/`k`, page with PgUp/PgDn — so you pick by title, no UUID. `[R]` on the board opens the same picker. This reaches *backward* to a named session; `to` carries your *current* session *forward*. |
| `resume cleanup [--dry-run] [--older-than <days>]` | Delete old session transcripts/databases to free disk space. Interactive — previews and asks before deleting; never touches tank configs, memory, or settings. `--dry-run` just previews; `--older-than` (default 30) scopes by age. |
| `eval "$(clikae env <engine> <tank>)"` | Put the **current shell** on a tank (export its config env var), so the engine's own command and `clikae status`/`to` see it. The explicit alternative to the one-shot bare switch. |

### Make & manage tanks

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `init <engine> <tank> [--alias]` | Create the tank directory; with `--alias`, also write a shell alias. |
| `remove <engine> <tank> [--force] [--keep-data]` | Remove dir + alias + `.app`. `--keep-data` keeps the directory. |
| `rename <engine> <old> <new> [--force]` | Rename a tank (moves the dir, rewrites the alias, carries the login). |
| `migrate [<engine>] [--dry-run] [--force] [--keep-login]` | Adopt a hand-rolled config-dir + alias setup. |
| `alias <engine> <tank> [--name <n>]` | Write (or replace) a shell alias. Default name `<engine>-<tank>`. |
| `app <engine> <tank> [--terminal <app>] [--force] [--out <dir>]` | Generate a macOS `.app` launcher (default `~/Applications`). macOS only. `--terminal`: `terminal` (default), `iterm2`, `ghostty`. |
| `app --board [--terminal <app>] [--force] [--out <dir>]` | Generate a `clikae.app` that opens the **board** (the menu of recent sessions + tanks) instead of one tank — a single double-click button for the whole on-ramp. |

> **Ghostty launchers** pass their command through a trusted Ghostty **config file**
> (`--config-file=`), not `-e`. Ghostty pops an "Allow Ghostty to execute…?" dialog
> for an externally-injected `-e` command (so a `-e` launcher looks like an empty
> shell until you click Allow); a config file is trusted, so the window just opens.
> The config lives inside the `.app` and is found via `path to me`, so the launcher
> keeps working if you move it.

### Keep burning when a tank runs dry

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `to [target] [tank]` | Carry this shell's session onward when a tank runs dry. **Bare `clikae to`** falls through to the next tank in your burn order (same engine → a real resume; a different engine → a cold-start brief). Your tanks are the reserve — nothing to configure. |
| `auto [ask\|safe\|full]` | **(BETA, claude-launched sessions only)** How much clikae carries on its own when a session **you launched through `clikae`** hits the limit — it has no effect on alias/`.app`/other-engine launches. `ask` (default) prompts; `safe` auto-resumes same-engine + asks to cross; `full` keeps going (same-engine = resume, cross-engine = a cold brief). The board's `A` key cycles it. |
| `watch <engine> [<tank>] [--auto] [--to <target>]` | Watch a session and fall through to the next tank in the burn order when it runs dry (cross-engine via `--to`). |
| `burn <engine> <tank> --artifact <path> -- <cmd…>` | Run a **headless** task on a tank; verify it by the artifact (not the exit code); on a dry tank, re-fire the same task on the next reserve tank. The headless sibling of `to`/`watch`. See "Headless tasks" below. |

> **Supervised launch (BETA · claude · feedback welcome).** When you start claude
> *through* clikae, clikae stays as the parent. **When that session ends after
> hitting its limit** — quit the dead session in an interactive run; a headless
> `claude -p` exits on its own — clikae carries you onward to the next tank in your
> burn order (per `clikae auto`) in the **same terminal** (one redraw), and your
> conversation continues there. Honest limits: it advances *on exit*, not by killing
> a live session mid-stream (that needs engine support — see issue
> anthropics/claude-code#35744); one hop per run; interactive **codex** can't be
> auto-detected (no file signal) so it's claude-only for now. Nothing runs in the
> background unless you launched it through clikae (no daemon) — deliberate.
> `clikae status` shows what it carried (recent carries). **Tell us how it feels.**

### Inspect

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| *(no args)* | Open the **home dashboard** — your "tank board": every tank grouped by engine, the one active in this shell marked, account + alias name, an "Also available" list of engines/targets you can open without a tank (e.g. `codex`, `agy`). On a terminal it's an **interactive launcher**; press `?` for the full key legend. Keys: ↑/↓·`j`/`k`·Tab/Shift-Tab move, `g`/`G` top/bottom, `1`-`9` jump, ⏎ open (a Continue row offers _resume_ vs _switch fresh_), `r` carry session, `x` incognito, `n` new, `a` rename the tank, `d` delete, `/` filter, `l` pick language, `q`/Esc quit. Piped/scripted it prints the same board as plain text (`CLIKAE_NO_INTERACTIVE` forces that). |
| `lang [en-US\|ja-JP\|zh-TW]` | Show or set the interface language (dashboard + prompts). Persists to `$CLIKAE_HOME/lang`; the board's `l` key opens a language picker. Resolution when unset: `$CLIKAE_LANG` > saved choice > `$LC_ALL` > `$LANG` > en-US. |
| `tanks [-p\|--paths] [--json]` | List all tanks, with the logged-in account where the adapter can tell. (Aliases: `list`, `ls`.) `--json` emits machine-readable output `{cli, profile, account, path}` for scripts and the GUI. |
| `status [<engine>] [--json]` | Show which tank each engine is on **in this shell**. `--json` emits one object per engine with a `state` enum. |
| `doctor` | Read-only health check: which supported engines are installed and logged in, how many tanks each has, the environment, and what to do next. |
| `info [--json]` | Show install paths, platform, adapters, and tank count. |
| `adapters` | List supported engines with descriptions. |
| `demo` | A 30-second guided tour in a throwaway sandbox — shows isolated tanks, the tank board, and the `to` idea (your tanks are the reserve), then cleans up. Touches nothing real; the accounts are simulated, so it needs no installed engine. |

### Antigravity (agy) — same verbs, one power mode

agy hardcodes `~/.gemini` and ignores env vars, so clikae can't switch it
per-shell like other engines. It folds into the **same verbs** anyway, via an
opt-in symlink-swap power mode (global: one tank active at a time across all
terminals; reversible):

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `init agy <tank>` | First time: warns and asks before taking `~/.gemini` over (backs it up, migrates your current login into a `default` tank), then creates `<tank>`. After: just creates the tank. |
| `agy <tank>` | Switch the active tank (refuses if agy is running) and start agy. Prints a global-switch notice. |
| `remove agy <tank>` | Remove the tank. Removing the **last** tank offers to restore a normal `~/.gemini` and turn the power mode off. |
| `agy --release` | Restore a normal single-account `~/.gemini` from the active tank, keep the tank dirs. |

## Shells

`clikae` auto-detects your shell from `$SHELL` and writes the alias to the right
rc file: **zsh** (`~/.zshrc`), **bash** (`~/.bash_profile` on macOS, else
`~/.bashrc`), and **fish** (`~/.config/fish/config.fish`). For fish it emits fish
syntax — `alias <name> 'env VAR=val <binary>'` — because fish has no inline
`VAR=val cmd`; the result behaves identically. `clikae remove` cleans up the
block in any of them.

## Migrating an existing setup

Already juggling accounts by hand — say a `~/.claude-acct-a` / `~/.claude-acct-b`
pair with aliases in your `~/.zshrc`? `clikae migrate` adopts that into clikae:

```bash
clikae migrate --dry-run   # preview: which dirs move where, which aliases change
clikae migrate             # do it (asks to confirm first)
```

It scans your shell rc for aliases that set the engine's config env var and
invoke the engine. For each one it:

1. moves the referenced config directory under `~/.clikae/profiles/<engine>/<p>/`,
2. rewrites the alias into clikae's managed sentinel block.

The rc file is backed up to `<rc>.clikae.bak.<timestamp>` first, and an existing
clikae tank is never overwritten. Pass an engine name (`clikae migrate gh`) to
migrate a different tool's aliases. Default is `claude`.

> ⚠️ **Don't migrate a config dir that's currently in use.** `migrate` *moves*
> the directory, so if a process is running against it right now (e.g. you run
> `clikae migrate` from inside the very `claude` session whose
> `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` points at the dir being moved), you pull the directory out
> from under that live process — it can fail to write, or recreate an empty dir
> at the old path and leave you with two half-states. Run `migrate` from a fresh
> shell with no instance of that engine active. `--dry-run` is always safe.
>
> As of v0.4, `migrate` guards against the most common form of this: if
> `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` (or whichever env var the adapter uses) currently points
> at a directory slated to move, it refuses and tells you to retry from a fresh
> shell. The guard is not bypassed by `--force` — it protects your data, it
> isn't a confirmation prompt.

> 🔑 **macOS + claude: expect a one-time re-login per migrated tank.** On
> macOS, Claude Code keeps its login token in the **login Keychain**, not inside
> `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` — and the keychain entry is keyed by the config-dir path.
> Because `migrate` moves the dir to a new path, claude no longer finds the token
> and asks you to log in once for each migrated tank. Your data is intact;
> only the saved login doesn't follow the move. To avoid the re-login, pass
> `--keep-login`, which copies the saved token from the old path's keychain entry
> to the new one (macOS only; it never reads or transmits the token anywhere — it
> stays in your Keychain). macOS may prompt you to allow keychain access.

## Carrying a session when you hit a usage limit — `clikae to`

This is clikae's origin story: you keep a second account precisely because one
account's quota runs out mid-task. `clikae to` lets you carry the work onward —
like swapping a fuel tank — and **keep the same conversation going** on a fresh
quota.

```bash
# You're working on claude tank `a` and just hit its limit. From the same project
# directory, carry the conversation onto another tank and keep going:
clikae to b                     # same engine → a real resume, on b's quota
clikae to codex                 # a different engine → a written brief (cold start)
clikae to codex work            # cross to a specific tank of another engine
```

clikae auto-detects which engine + tank this shell is on: first the live env var,
then — since the bare switch / aliases / `.app` run the engine with a prefix
assignment that never reaches the parent shell — **the tank with this directory's
most recent session** (the one you were just in here). So `switch → work → to`
works from one shell. To pin a shell to a tank explicitly instead, use
`eval "$(clikae env <engine> <tank>)"`. The target resolves **engine-name-first**:
a known engine name crosses to it; anything else is a tank of your current engine.
clikae always **announces which mechanism it used** so resume-vs-brief is never a
guess.

**Same engine (a resume).** For Claude Code, clikae finds the **current
directory's** most recent transcript under the source tank, copies it into the
target tank, and runs `claude --resume <id>` there — so the conversation
continues, but every new turn burns the target tank's quota. The source tank is
left completely untouched (it copies, never moves), so you can always go back.
A preview + confirm is shown before anything moves; `-y` skips it, `--fresh`
switches tanks without carrying, `--session <id>` carries a specific session.

> Carry-over relies on Claude Code's on-disk transcript layout
> (`<config-dir>/projects/<slug>/<id>.jsonl`) and `--resume`. It's verified
> against current Claude Code; if a future version changes that layout, it falls
> back to a fresh start rather than doing anything destructive.

**A different engine (a brief).** A different *model* or *vendor* can't resume a
foreign session — there's no shared transcript format. So clikae writes a
**handoff brief** (what you're doing, what's done, what's next) and starts the
target engine seeded with it as the opening prompt. clikae tries to write a
**summary** automatically: if a local model CLI is on your PATH (`apfel`,
`ollama`, or `llm`), it's used to summarise the brief for free — set
`CLIKAE_HANDOFF_AUTOLOCAL=0` to disable that auto-detection. Otherwise the brief
is a **raw extract** (session metadata + your recent prompts), clearly labelled
as raw. To force a specific summariser, point clikae at any model so writing the
brief costs nothing on the tank that just ran dry:

```bash
export CLIKAE_HANDOFF_SUMMARIZER='llm -m my-local-model'   # any stdin→stdout command
clikae to codex                                            # the model writes the brief
```

The summarizer (auto-detected or `CLIKAE_HANDOFF_SUMMARIZER`) receives, on stdin,
an instruction line followed by the tail of the session transcript, and writes the
brief to stdout. If it produces nothing, clikae falls back to the raw extract so a
handoff is never lost. Tune how much
transcript is fed with `$CLIKAE_HANDOFF_LINES` (default `60`). Carrying onward is
**read-only** on the source — it never touches the source session or any tank.

> Under the hood, `clikae to` delegates to `relay` (same engine) or `handoff`
> (different engine). Both remain available as hidden aliases — e.g. `clikae
> handoff claude --out HANDOFF.md` just writes a brief to a file without starting
> anything. Run `clikae help to` / `help relay` / `help handoff` for details.

## Ambient: notice a dry tank and switch (`watch`)

Instead of switching by hand, let clikae watch for the moment a tank runs dry and
fall through to the next one. **Your tanks are the reserve — there's nothing to
set up.** Just watch the current session:

```bash
clikae watch claude            # offer to switch to the next claude tank when dry
clikae watch claude --auto     # switch automatically (asks once for consent)
clikae watch claude --to codex/work   # cross to a specific tank/engine instead
```

When it detects a dry tank it carries onward to the next tank of the same engine
(skipping any that are themselves over quota); cross-engine needs an explicit
`--to`. By default it **asks first**; `--auto` switches
automatically after a **one-time consent** (remembered in
`$CLIKAE_HOME/auto-relay-consent` — delete that file to revoke), and always tells
you what it did.

> **Honest caveat.** An interactive engine hitting its usage limit doesn't exit,
> returns no code, and fires no hook — so the only thing clikae can watch is what
> the limit writes to disk. For claude that's the session transcript; for agy
> it's `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/cli.log` (agy's `-p` run exits 0 with empty
> output, so the log line is the only signal). codex's limit is **proven not

> disk. Confirm/tune the match the first time you actually get limited:
>
> ```bash
> clikae watch claude --check          # would the pattern fire on this session?
> CLIKAE_LIMIT_PATTERN='…' clikae watch claude   # override the match
> ```

## Headless tasks across tanks — `clikae burn`

`watch`/`auto` carry an *interactive* session. For *headless* grunt work — the
"let the cheaper tank do the dirty work" case — use `clikae burn`. It runs one
task on a tank and, crucially, knows whether it actually finished: it verifies by
the **artifact** the task must produce, never the exit code (`codex exec` exits 0
even when it hit its usage limit and wrote nothing). If the tank ran dry, it
re-fires the *same* task on the next tank in your reserve.

```bash
# Distil a file with codex on tank M; if M is dry, fall through to your next
# codex tank automatically. Success = /tmp/out.md exists.
clikae burn codex M --artifact /tmp/out.md -- \
    exec -C /tmp -s workspace-write "read /tmp/in.txt, write /tmp/out.md"

clikae burn codex M --artifact /tmp/out.md --to codex/H -- exec … "<task>"   # explicit next hop
clikae burn codex M --artifact /tmp/out.md --timeout 300 -- exec … "<task>"  # bound a long run
```

Outcomes: artifact present → done; dry on every reachable tank → fail; ran but
produced no artifact and showed no limit → a real **task failure** (not rerouted —
it would fail the same everywhere). `--no-reroute` runs once and stops on a dry tank.

`burn` is the single-task unit — **batch/parallelism stays your orchestrator's
job** (fan several `burn`s out, review the artifacts). Make tasks idempotent and
artifact-checked (fixed input/output paths), and pre-stage inputs to `/tmp` rather
than handing a tank slow iCloud-backed I/O.

**`burn` won't spend the quota you're using.** Its auto-reroute *skips* a tank an
interactive session is live on (it would otherwise burn the conversation you're
mid-flight in) and tanks that share an already-dry account. Pass `--allow-active`
to override the in-use skip, or `--to <tank>` to name a hop explicitly.

**A tank is a *quota* source, not the content.** `burn <engine> <tank>` spends
*that tank's quota* to run a command; what the command reads/writes is just files,
unrelated to tanks. So you can spend a cheap tank's quota to chew on *any* file —
including another tank's transcript.

**Using agy as a cheap read-only worker.** agy can't be a `burn` *tank* (it's one
global account — there's no reserve to reroute among), but it's a fine headless
worker — you just invoke it directly, outside `burn`'s reserve wrapper:

```bash
# agy as a summariser — content in via stdin, agy's own quota spent. Read-only.
cat /tmp/in.md | agy --sandbox -p "summarise this"  > /tmp/out.md

# …or through clikae, on a specific agy account (switches the global ~/.gemini
# symlink to tank R, then runs agy headless on R's quota):
clikae agy R -- -p "summarise this" --sandbox  < /tmp/in.md  > /tmp/out.md
```

You give up `burn`'s two guarantees here (no dry→reroute — agy has one account, so
a dry run just fails; no artifact verification), and remember `clikae agy` switches
a **machine-wide** symlink, not a per-shell env (and agy has no `--model` flag — the
model is the app's setting).

## Seeing which tank you're on

```bash
clikae status            # every engine that has a tank
clikae status claude     # just one

#   ENGINE       TANK         ACCOUNT          SOURCE
#   claude       cver         hi@cver.net      CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=…/profiles/claude/cver
#   aws          (default)    -                AWS_PROFILE unset — system default
```

`status` reads the **live** value of each adapter's env var in the current shell
and resolves it back to a clikae tank. It's a per-shell view: another terminal
(or one launched from a different `clikae app`) can be on a different tank.
`(default)` means the env var is unset (the engine's own default); `(external)`
means it points somewhere that isn't a clikae tank. The ACCOUNT column shows
the logged-in account when the adapter can tell.

## Naming your tanks

Name tanks however makes sense to you — `work`, `personal`, a client name, or
the account email. You don't have to remember what a bare `a`/`b` meant: both
`tanks` and `status` show the logged-in **account** when the adapter can read it.

Changed your mind about a name? `clikae rename` moves the directory, rewrites the
managed alias, and — for claude on macOS — carries the saved Keychain login
across so you don't have to log in again:

```bash
clikae rename claude a cver        # a → cver; login + alias follow
```

It refuses if the new name is taken or if that engine is currently using the tank
in this shell (run it from a fresh shell). A pre-existing `.app` launcher is left
alone but flagged — recreate it with `clikae app claude cver`.

## Ephemeral memory (`--ephemeral`)

For the surgical, leave-no-trace run: `clikae claude work --ephemeral` switches to
the tank and runs it, but points the engine's **long-term memory** at a throwaway
directory that's discarded when the engine quits. The tank's real memory is
stashed aside and restored, untouched.

```bash
clikae claude work --ephemeral     # incognito: nothing learned this session is kept
```

- **Login and transcripts are normal** — only the *memory store* is throwaway
  (you're still you, the conversation is still logged/resumable).
- **Honest scope:** clikae guarantees the *memory directory* is a throwaway. It
  can't promise the engine "remembers nothing anywhere" — caches, shell history,
  telemetry, the macOS Keychain are outside clikae's reach. So it's *ephemeral
  memory*, not guaranteed total amnesia.
- Supported only for engines whose memory layout clikae knows (currently
  **claude**); others say so and exit.
- Unlike a normal switch (which `exec`s the engine), `--ephemeral` runs it as a
  child so cleanup can run on exit. A crashed run self-heals on the next
  `--ephemeral` (the real memory is recovered from its stash).

## How it works

For each tank, `clikae`:

1. Creates `~/.clikae/profiles/<engine>/<tank>/` — the directory the engine's env
   var (e.g. `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`) points at. (The on-disk path keeps the word
   `profiles` for stability; you only ever type/​see *tank*.)
2. (`alias`) Appends a sentinel-wrapped block to your shell rc:
   ```
   # >>> clikae:claude.work >>>
   alias claude-work='CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR="/Users/you/.clikae/profiles/claude/work" claude'
   # <<< clikae:claude.work <<<
   ```
   The sentinels make safe, exact removal possible.
3. (`app`, macOS) Generates an AppleScript-compiled `.app` that opens a terminal,
   runs the env-var-prefixed engine, and sets the window title to `claude (work)`
   so you can tell windows apart. The terminal is **Terminal.app** by default;
   `--terminal iterm2` and `--terminal ghostty` target those instead (set
   `$CLIKAE_TERMINAL` to change the default). Terminal.app and iTerm2 are driven
   by AppleScript; Ghostty has no window-opening CLI on macOS, so its launcher
   goes through `open -na Ghostty.app --args … -e …`.

No daemons, no global state, no network calls. You can read every line.

## Supported engines

| Engine | Strategy | Env var |
|---|---|---|
| `claude` (Anthropic Claude Code) | `env-dir` | `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` |
| `codex` (OpenAI Codex CLI) | `env-dir` | `CODEX_HOME` |
| `gh` (GitHub CLI) | `env-dir` | `GH_CONFIG_DIR` |
| `gcloud` (Google Cloud CLI) | `env-dir` | `CLOUDSDK_CONFIG` |
| `docker` (Docker CLI) | `env-dir` | `DOCKER_CONFIG` |
| `helm` | `env-dir` | `HELM_CONFIG_HOME` |
| `kubectl` | `env-file` | `KUBECONFIG` |
| `aws` (AWS CLI) | `env-var` | `AWS_PROFILE` |
| `az` (Azure CLI) | `env-dir` | `AZURE_CONFIG_DIR` |
| `npm` | `env-file` | `NPM_CONFIG_USERCONFIG` |
| `terraform` | `env-file` | `TF_CLI_CONFIG_FILE` |
| `pulumi` | `env-dir` | `PULUMI_HOME` |
| `vercel` (Vercel CLI) | `flag` | — (`--global-config <dir>`) |
| `agy` (Google Antigravity) | opt-in symlink | — (hardcoded `~/.gemini`; see above) |

The `flag` strategy is for engines with no config-directory env var: the tank
directory is injected as a command-line flag (e.g. vercel's `--global-config`)
